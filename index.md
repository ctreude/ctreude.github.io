# Hi!

Christoph Treude is an Associate Professor of [Computer Science](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/) at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). His research focuses on improving software quality and developer productivity by enhancing access to relevant information, with a strong emphasis on the role of AI in software engineering.

His work spans **AI & Software Engineering (AI&SE)**, **human-AI collaboration**, **AI for science**, and **empirical and automated software engineering**. Treude uses large-scale empirical studies and develops intelligent tools that leverage natural language artifacts in software repositories to support developers more effectively.

He has authored [over 150 scientific publications in collaboration with more than 250 co-authors](/publications.html). His research has been recognized with five best paper awards, including three [ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards](https://www.sigsoft.org/awards/distinguishedPaperAward.html), and has received funding from [Google](https://research.google/outreach/past-programs/faculty-research-awards/), [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/blog/2021/09/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2021-rfp-on-agent-based-user-interaction-simulation-to-find-and-fix-integrity-and-privacy-issues/), [DST](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/), and through an [ARC Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (2018–2020)](https://www.arc.gov.au/grants/discovery-program/discovery-early-career-researcher-award-decra).

Before joining SMU, he held senior academic positions at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) and the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/), and postdoctoral appointments at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/#english), and the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte](https://www.ufrn.br/en).

He currently serves on the editorial boards of the [IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ts) and [Empirical Software Engineering (Springer)](https://www.springer.com/journal/10664), and as [Open Science Editor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-systems-and-software/special-issue/10XMGH48FFT) for the [Journal of Systems and Software (Elsevier)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-systems-and-software). He is co-chairing the program committee for [FSE 2026](https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2026) and regularly serves on program committees across leading software engineering venues.
