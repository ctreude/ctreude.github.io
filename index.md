# Hi!

I'm an [ARC DECRA Fellow](https://www.arc.gov.au/grants/discovery-program/discovery-early-career-researcher-award-decra){:target="_blank"} and [Senior Lecturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_lecturer){:target="_blank"} in the [School of Computer Science](https://ecms.adelaide.edu.au/computer-science/){:target="_blank"} at the [University of Adelaide, Australia](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/){:target="_blank"}. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Victoria, Canada](https://www.uvic.ca/){:target="_blank"} in 2012. My main research area is Software Engineering, and the goal of my research is to get information to software developers when and where they need it. I currently serve on the editorial board of the [Empirical Software Engineering journal](https://www.springer.com/journal/10664){:target="_blank"} and as general co-chair for the [IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2020](https://icsme2020.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.
