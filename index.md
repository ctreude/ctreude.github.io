# Hi!

Christoph Treude is an Associate Professor of [Computer Science](https://computing.smu.edu.sg/) at [Singapore Management University](https://www.smu.edu.sg/). His primary research goal is to improve software quality and the efficiency of software developers, particularly by improving access to relevant information.

Treude’s research methodology combines empirical studies with the development of tools and approaches that consider the diverse natural language artifacts in software repositories. He has authored [over 150 scientific articles with more than 250 co-authors](https://ctreude.ca/publications/). His work has received recognition, including an [ARC Discovery Early Career Research Award (2018-2020)](https://www.arc.gov.au/grants/discovery-program/discovery-early-career-researcher-award-decra) and funding from industry leaders such as [Google](https://research.google/outreach/past-programs/faculty-research-awards/), [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/blog/2021/09/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2021-rfp-on-agent-based-user-interaction-simulation-to-find-and-fix-integrity-and-privacy-issues/), and [DST](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/).

Treude has received four best paper awards, including two [ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Awards](https://www.sigsoft.org/awards/distinguishedPaperAward.html). Before joining Singapore Management University, he held senior lecturer positions at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/) and the [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/). He also worked as a postdoctoral researcher at [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), the [University of São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/#english), and the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte](https://www.ufrn.br/en).

Currently, Treude serves on the Editorial Boards of the [IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ts) and the [Springer journal on Empirical Software Engineering](https://www.springer.com/journal/10664). He also holds the role of [Open Science Editor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-systems-and-software/special-issue/10XMGH48FFT) for the [Elsevier Journal of Systems and Software](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-systems-and-software). He has chaired conferences such as [ICSME 2020](https://conferences.computer.org/icsme/#!/toc/0), [ICPC 2023](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icpc-2023), and [TechDebt 2023](https://conf.researchr.org/home/TechDebt-2023) and regularly participates in software engineering conference program committees.
